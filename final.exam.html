		<h1>Rise of Technology</h1>
    <h2 class="color">Fahmida Kabir</h2>
    <p class="color">
This is a simple illustration of the wind power technology. The project starts with a basic green background showing how the earth evolved from having nothing on it to gradually giving birth to nature and finally we introduced technology and being able to function effectively. My goal was to present to the audience the evolvement of the earth and how with the flow of time it is allowing us to perform such intricate things like we introduced technology on the planet earth. like this we can do so much more but this was just a small and easy concept to make people understand the bigger picture and how they can work to make this world a better place. The first image is the storboard showing the audience the sequence and below this image is the complete animation project.
